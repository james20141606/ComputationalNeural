## Introduction
This repository saves the codes and report in computational and systematic  neural biology taught by teachers in Department of Biomedical Engineering.
The homework in this course is much harder than neural biology course in life science school. I found it hard not because it needs lots of coding work, but it needs many understanding and study after class. By doing this homework I have learned a lot about imaging and computational tools in neural biology.

### HW1
in homework1, we are required to analyze fMRI data and signal data. We pick voxels according to their index and calculate its ratio and asymmetry. We use ICP and $r^2$ to calculate asymmetry. Then we analyze BOLD signal using mricron and writing codes. I use GLM to test activated voxels and plot peristimulus plot. Then we analyze spike signal data to plot tuning curve and FRA heatmap
